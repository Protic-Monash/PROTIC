**PROTIC 2** is a collaboration between Monash Faculty of Information Technology and OXFAM that focuses on digital citizenship for members of disadvantaged communities in Bangladesh.
‘PROTIC’ means a sign or symbol in Bengali. This word therefore articulates the symbol of development and progress, the sign of digitisation, a token of recognition (of community voice) and the image of action research (by Monash and Oxfam).
Endowed with a $2.15 million philanthropic fund, PROTIC 2 is the second phase of PROTIC, a five-year international development project that was dedicated to empowering rural women in Bangladesh. One element of this initiative was supporting these women through the use of mobile devices 

Project objectives

The project seeks to articulate the impact of societal digital transformation initiatives on disadvantaged and low-literacy communities. It also aims to develop contextually and culturally-sensitive strategies and actions to ensure that citizens are not marginalised further.

## Project

PROTIC 2 is working with partners in Bangladesh on 2 projects focusing on empowering 2 marginalised groups: 
- Female domestic workers and Hilsa fisherfolks. The Securing Rights of Women Domestic Workers in Bangladesh, supported by Global Affairs Canada,  aim at strengthening the agency of women domestic workers to claim and defend their rights in relation to decent employment. Partners in Bangladesh include Oxfam Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS), CAMPE, HelloTask, NariMaitree, RedOrangeMedia and Communications, and UCEP Bangladesh.
- Trans-Boundary  Rivers Of South Asia (TROSA), supported by the Government of Sweden, aim at reducing poverty and marginalisation among vulnerable river fishing communities through access to and control over the riverine water resources on which their livelihood depends. Partners in Bangladesh include Oxfam Bangladesh, CNRS and GUK.

**The 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science and Technology Information for a Sustainable World: _Addressing Society’s Grand Challenges_
Workshop: ICT for Development, Empowerment for Growth: How Can the Information Field Contribute?**

Information and communications technology for development (ICT4D), which is devoted to leveraging ICT for economic, social, and governance development, has attracted wide attention from scholars and practitioners. However, gaps remain to be addressed in terms of bridging the connections between information, technological development and adoption, and people for development. Through this workshop, we will develop research ideas and foster collaboration opportunities across information fields, which will lay the groundwork for a JASIST special issue on ICT4D. The ASIS&T Annual Meeting provides an excellent forum to discuss this crucial area together with the academics and industry peers.
